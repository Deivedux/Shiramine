# Shiramine
A multilingual general-purpose Discord bot.


# Features

## Help

* The bot comes with a `>help` function that shows the list of all available commands. 
* You can type `>help <exampleCommand>` to see more information about each command.


## Set Language

* The key feature is to let individual servers to use a specific language in which the bot will respond in. This makes it that all communities get the full experience by letting everyone to understand what each response means.

* If you do not see your language in our list of available languages, this means that we do not yet have translators to support that language. Believe it or not, but we do not know every single language for you to deliver, so instead we are recruiting a team of translators to help us with this mission! If you are interested, [join our support server](https://discord.gg/sbySHxA) for more information.


## Custom Prefix

* Don't like `.` as your server's prefix? You can change it by using `.prefix <your custom prefix>` eg: `.prefix !`.


## Basic Moderation

* Shiramine has one of the simpliest moderation system, without needing to set up anything. It fully relies on Discord's permissions system to ensure whether the user has permission to punish someone or not.

  * **Kicks and (soft)bans** checks the user's highest role that has a specific required permission to execute the command.

  * **Self-assignable roles** lets members freely assign or remove any roles they want from a set of whitelisted roles without having role management permissions.

  * **Automatic image filter** detects any attachment image sent in a normal channel and deletes it if the image's NSFW rates are equal to, or high enough, to your custom set harshness level.

  * **Member persistence** is a greatly demanding feature for every server, as when the member leaves the server and they had roles and/or a nickname, it saves them in the database for later, so when the user joins again they get all their stuff back.


## Member Presence

* Welcome/leave messages enables you to create a warm welcome for your new members and/or letting them know of your server rules, or notify the existing members of someone's lack of presence.

  * **Customizable messages** lets you set the perfect first impression for your members as they join in.

  * **Greeting members** is scalable to be sent either in a server or directly into their DMs, or even both.

  * **Automatic message deletion** lets you avoid the flood of welcome/leave messages if you so desire.


## Invite Lookup

* Have an invite URL and want to see what the server is about but don't want to be caught joining? You can now look up the general information about the invite and the server that it leads to.


## Useful & Fun

* Display general information about a chosen user or a current server.

* Randomize a member from the server, or within a role.


# Anti-Bot Farm

* Quote will leave any server with more than 20 members that has more than 70% of the population composed of Bots.
